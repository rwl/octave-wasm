/* The i386 floating point hardware (the 387 compatible FPU, not the modern
   SSE/SSE2 hardware) has a controllable rounding precision.  It is specified
   through the 'PC' bits in the FPU control word ('fctrl' register).  (See
   the GNU libc i386 <fpu_control.h> header for details.)

   On some platforms, such as Linux or Solaris, the default precision setting
   is set to "extended precision".  This means that 'long double' instructions
   operate correctly, but 'double' computations often produce slightly
   different results as on strictly IEEE 754 conforming systems.

   On some platforms, such as NetBSD, the default precision is set to
   "double precision".  This means that 'long double' instructions will operate
   only as 'double', i.e. lead to wrong results.  Similarly on FreeBSD 6.4, at
   least for the division of 'long double' numbers.

   The FPU control word is under control of the application, i.e. it is
   not required to be set either way by the ABI.  (In fact, the i386 ABI
   https://www.linux-mips.org/pub/linux/mips/doc/ABI/abi386-4.pdf page 3-12 = page 38
   is not clear about it.  But in any case, gcc treats the control word
   like a "preserved" register: it emits code that assumes that the control
   word is preserved across calls, and it restores the control word at the
   end of functions that modify it.)

   See Vincent Lef√®vre's page https://www.vinc17.net/research/extended.en.html
   for a good explanation.
