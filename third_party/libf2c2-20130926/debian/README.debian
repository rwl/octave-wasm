libf2c for debian
-----------------

Original source downloaded from:
ftp://netlib.bell-labs.com/netlib/f2c/libf2c.zip

As sugested by upstream in their README, f2c.h was extended to use only
'int' instead of 'long int' on architectures where the size of the latter
is 8 bytes (alpha, ia64, amd64 and sparc64) and makes libf2c not
compatible with g77. All other architectures still use "long int".

The libF77 has been MODIFIED to work on MC68k machines.  Thus the 
libf77 file now differs from that in the original version.  I hope
this will be temporary until the M68K is fully supported by f2c.  This
only affects the new -trapuv (trap unitialised values) flag which 
requires the co-processor exception control mask to be set up.
