libf2c2 (20061008-4.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Don't sed away long on alpha and ia64, that was an ugly hack.
  * Instead add some ifdefs to f2c.h so we catch all archs where
    a long is 8 bytes and use only int there (make sure not to break
    other architectures by keeping long int there).
    Update README.debian accordingly.
    Also update f2c.h0 and f2c_master.h, so the files match, even if
    they are unused.
    Closes: #442018, #508565.
  * Clean debian/*.debhelper.log.
